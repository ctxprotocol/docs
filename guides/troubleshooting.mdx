## Common Errors

### `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`

**This is the most common error for new tool builders.**

<Warning>
The `createContextMiddleware()` from `@ctxprotocol/sdk` verifies that requests come from the Context Platform with a valid JWT. Without this JWT, any call to `tools/call` will return `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`.
</Warning>

#### Why This Happens

| Cause | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Missing JWT on `tools/call`** | The middleware requires a JWT from the Context Platform for execution methods. |
| **HTTP instead of HTTPS** | Context Platform only connects to HTTPS endpoints. HTTP will silently fail. |
| **Not registered on marketplace** | Until you register at [ctxprotocol.com/contribute](https://ctxprotocol.com/contribute), the platform won't send requests to your server. |
| **Wrong endpoint URL** | The URL you registered doesn't match your deployed server. |

#### What You CAN Test Locally (No Auth Required)

These MCP methods work without authentication:

```bash
# Initialize session (no auth required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}},"id":1}'

# List tools (no auth required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: YOUR-SESSION-ID-FROM-INITIALIZE" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":2}'
```

#### Testing `tools/call` Locally

The `tools/call` method requires a valid JWT from the Context Platform. Options for testing:

1. **Test tool logic directly** — Write test files that call your tool handler functions directly, bypassing the MCP transport
2. **Temporarily bypass middleware** — Comment out `verifyContextAuth` during development:
   ```typescript
   // Development: bypass auth for testing
   // app.post("/mcp", verifyContextAuth, async (req, res) => { ... });
   app.post("/mcp", async (req, res) => { ... });
   ```
3. **Test on deployed server** — SSH into your server and test against localhost after deployment

<Warning>
**Remember to re-enable the middleware before going live!** Without it, anyone can call your tools for free.
</Warning>

#### End-to-End Testing

For full end-to-end testing through the Context Platform:
1. **Deploy to HTTPS** — Use Railway, Vercel, or set up Caddy/nginx
2. **Register on marketplace** — Go to [ctxprotocol.com/contribute](https://ctxprotocol.com/contribute)
3. **Test through the Context app** — Ask the agent to use your tool

### Tool Not Discovered

Your server is deployed but Context can't find your tools.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200: `curl https://your-server.com/health`
- [ ] `initialize` works: Test with curl (see above)
- [ ] `tools/list` returns your tools: Test with curl after initialize
- [ ] URL is HTTPS (not HTTP)
- [ ] URL ends with `/mcp` (e.g., `https://your-server.com/mcp`)
- [ ] Tools have `outputSchema` defined (required by Context)

---

### New/Updated Tools Not Appearing

You deployed new endpoints but they're not showing up in the marketplace.

**This is the most common oversight after updating your MCP server.**

#### Solution

1. Go to [ctxprotocol.com/developer/tools](https://www.ctxprotocol.com/developer/tools) → **Developer Tools** (My Tools)
2. Find your tool and click **"Refresh Skills"**
3. Context will re-call `listTools()` to discover your changes

#### Also Consider

- **Update your description** — If you added significant new functionality, use the [MCP Server Analysis Prompt](https://github.com/ctxprotocol/sdk/blob/main/docs/mcp-server-analysis-prompt.md) to generate an updated description
- **Verify deployment** — Make sure your new code is actually deployed (check health endpoint, test `tools/list` via curl)

### Server Won't Start

#### Node.js Version

```bash
node --version  # Must be 18+
```

#### Missing Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install  # or npm install
```

#### TypeScript Errors

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit  # Check for type errors
```

#### Module System Mismatch

Ensure your `package.json` has:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

---

### Railway Deployment Fails

1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Ensure `package.json` has `"type": "module"`
3. Set start command to: `pnpm start` or `npm start`
4. Verify `tsconfig.json` has correct module settings

---

### Response Schema Validation Fails

If your tool responses don't match your `outputSchema`, users can dispute them.

#### Common Causes

```typescript
// ❌ Schema says number, response is string
outputSchema: { value: { type: "number" } }
structuredContent: { value: "42" }  // String, not number!

// ✅ Correct: Types match
outputSchema: { value: { type: "number" } }
structuredContent: { value: 42 }  // Number
```

#### Solution

- Ensure all `structuredContent` fields match your `outputSchema` types exactly
- Use TypeScript to catch type mismatches at compile time
- Test your responses against the schema before deploying

## MCP Security Model Reference

Understanding which methods require authentication:

| MCP Method | Auth Required | Why |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| `initialize` | ❌ No | Session setup |
| `tools/list` | ❌ No | Discovery — agents need to see your schemas |
| `resources/list` | ❌ No | Discovery |
| `prompts/list` | ❌ No | Discovery |
| `tools/call` | ✅ **Yes** | **Execution — costs money, runs your code** |

<Info>
Discovery methods are intentionally open so AI agents can find your tools. Only execution (`tools/call`) requires payment verification through the Context Platform JWT.
</Info>
