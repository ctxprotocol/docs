## 🏆 Funding Tiers

### What Makes a Tier S Tool?

We don't pay for raw data dumps. We pay for **answers**.

| Feature | Raw Data (Tier B) | Curated Intelligence (Tier S) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Crypto** | "Here's the transaction list" | "Top 5 whales accumulating this token right now" |
| **Finance** | "Here's the SEC filing PDF" | "Key risk factors extracted with sentiment score" |
| **E-commerce** | "Here are Amazon search results" | "Estimated monthly revenue: $47K, trending up 23%" |
| **Competitive Intel** | "Here's their homepage HTML" | "Tech stack: Stripe, Vercel, Segment. 2.3M monthly visitors" |

**Tier S tools do the heavy lifting so the AI can act immediately.**

---

### 🦄 Tier S — $1,000 + Revenue Share

**High-value tools that replace expensive subscriptions.**

These unlock data people currently pay $500–$20,000/year for. Complex pipelines, novel analysis, or hard-to-access sources.

### 🛠️ Tier A — $250–$500 + Revenue Share

**High-utility tools agents query frequently.**

Reliable, well-documented tools that solve common needs. Think "best-in-class API wrapper with smart curation."

### 🚀 Tier B — Revenue Share Only

**Simple wrappers and adapters.**

No upfront grant, but immediate listing. Start earning from day one.

<Note>
**All tiers earn revenue share.** Even Tier B tools generate USDC the moment an agent queries them. You keep 90% of every fee.

This ensures tools are maintained and actually serve the marketplace.

## ❓ FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does approval take?">
    We review proposals within **48 hours**. Complex proposals may require a quick call.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I build multiple tools?">
    Absolutely. Each tool is evaluated independently. Build a suite of related tools for bonus consideration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my tool idea isn't on the RFB list?">
    The RFB is a starting point, not a limit. If you have a novel idea that agents would pay for, pitch it. We love surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I keep the revenue after the grant?">
    Yes! The grant is a one-time bootstrap. You keep **90% of all query fees forever**—that's the whole point.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What chain is payment on?">
    All payments (grants and revenue) are in **USDC on Base**. Low fees, instant settlement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use existing open-source code?">
    Yes, as long as you comply with the license. Wrapping an existing API or open-source tool is fine—just make it useful for agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the response time limit?">
    Tools must return data in **under 30 seconds**. This isn't the place for long-running simulations—focus on instant data retrieval and analysis.
  </Accordion>
