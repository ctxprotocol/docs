# 💰 Become a Data Broker

**You're not just writing code. You're building a revenue stream.**

Context Protocol is a decentralized marketplace where AI agents pay for data. We're the crypto-native rails that let developers act as **Data Brokers** — you build tools that LLMs lack, users pay per query, and you earn on every run.

If you can find a way to make other people money, you get to make money alongside them.

## 🎯 The Grant Pool

We're allocating **$10,000 USD** to bootstrap the supply side of the Context Marketplace.

Our goal: flood the registry with high-quality MCP servers that AI agents actually want to pay for.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Pool** | $10,000 USD |
| **Grant Range** | $250 – $1,000 per tool |
| **Expected Tools** | 15–40 new MCP servers |
| **Payment** | USDC (Base network) |

## 🏆 Funding Tiers

### 🦄 Tier S — $1,000 + Revenue Share

**Complex integrations that unlock new capabilities.**

These are tools that require significant engineering effort, novel data sources, or complex analysis pipelines.

| Examples | Why It's Tier S |
|----------|-----------------|
| On-chain analytics (whale tracking) | Complex data pipelines |
| AI-powered research (sentiment analysis) | Novel inference workloads |
| Multi-protocol data aggregation | Cross-chain coordination |
| Real-time market intelligence | High-frequency data streams |

---

### 🛠️ Tier A — $250–$500 + Revenue Share

**High-utility data fetchers that agents query frequently.**

Reliable, well-documented tools that solve common agent needs.

| Examples | Why It's Tier A |
|----------|-----------------|
| Protocol data (Aave rates, Uniswap pools) | High query volume |
| Market sentiment (Fear & Greed, social) | Frequently requested |
| Gas estimators (multi-chain) | Essential for tx planning |
| Price feeds (DexScreener, CoinGecko) | Core market data |

---

### 🚀 Tier B — Revenue Share Only

**Simple wrappers and API adapters.**

No upfront grant, but immediate listing on the marketplace. Perfect for quick wins.

| Examples | Why It's Tier B |
|----------|-----------------|
| REST API wrappers | Minimal engineering |
| Single-endpoint tools | Quick to build |
| Basic data transformations | Low complexity |

<Note>
**All tiers earn revenue share.** Even Tier B tools start generating USDC the moment an agent queries them. You earn 90% of every query fee.
</Note>

## 💸 Payment Terms

<Warning>
**Grant Payment Schedule (50/50 Split)**

- **50% on verification** — Paid when your tool passes our quality check and goes live
- **50% after 30 days** — Paid after 30 days of verified uptime and usage

This ensures tools are maintained and actually serve the marketplace.
</Warning>

### Quality Requirements

To receive grant payments, your tool must:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| ✅ Pass schema validation | `outputSchema` must match actual responses |
| ✅ Sub-5s response time | Agents expect fast data |
| ✅ 95%+ uptime (30 days) | Reliable for the second payment |
| ✅ Handle errors gracefully | Return structured errors, not crashes |

## ❓ FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does approval take?">
    We review proposals within **48 hours**. Complex proposals may require a quick call.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I build multiple tools?">
    Absolutely. Each tool is evaluated independently. Build a suite of related tools for bonus consideration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my tool idea isn't on the RFB list?">
    The RFB is a starting point, not a limit. If you have a novel idea that agents would pay for, pitch it. We love surprises.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I keep the revenue after the grant?">
    Yes! The grant is a one-time bootstrap. You keep **90% of all query fees forever** — that's the whole point.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What chain is payment on?">
    All payments (grants and revenue) are in **USDC on Base**. Low fees, instant settlement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use existing open-source code?">
    Yes, as long as you comply with the license. Wrapping an existing API is fine — just make it useful for agents.
  </Accordion>
