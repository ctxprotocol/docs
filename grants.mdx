# 💰 Become a Data Broker

**What \$500/year subscription could YOUR tool replace for \$0.10/response? What fragmented API mess could YOUR tool normalize for \$0.001/call?**

Bloomberg. SensorTower. SEMrush. ZoomInfo. PitchBook. These companies gatekeep data behind enterprise contracts. You can unbundle them — as curated intelligence for the Context app, as normalized data for SDK developers, or both.

Context Protocol is a decentralized marketplace where AI agents pay for data. Build an MCP tool that delivers value, and you earn **90% of usage fees** (Query responses and eligible Execute calls).

<Info>
**🎯 North Star:** We fund MCP tools that deliver data people currently overpay for. That means two things:

- **Curated intelligence (Query mode):** Unbundle \$500/year subscriptions into \$0.10/response insights — Context is the librarian, your tool provides the analysis.
- **Normalized data infrastructure (Execute mode):** Replace fragmented APIs with clean, typed, consistent data endpoints at \$0.001/call — the developer's agent is the librarian, your tool provides the building blocks.
</Info>

<Tip>
**💡 Finding Unbundling Opportunities:** Use [Grok](https://grok.com) to search Twitter for users discussing premium subscriptions. Look for both frustrated users trying to cancel ("not worth it", "only use one feature") AND evangelists explaining exactly why they pay ("worth every penny because", "can't get this data anywhere else"). Both signals reveal the core value users extract from subscriptions giving you a roadmap for what to reverse engineer as a \$0.10/response MCP tool.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**🚫 What We Don't Fund**

We reject proposals that:

- **Wrap a single public API without adding value**: Calling CoinGecko and returning the JSON isn't a product. For Query mode, add analysis, scoring, or synthesis. For Execute mode, normalize across multiple sources into a consistent typed schema — that's the value.
- **Chase dead or saturated markets**: Meme coin tooling, yield aggregators, and rug checkers had their moment. The alpha is gone.
- **Compete with dominant free alternatives**: If Semantic Scholar, Etherscan, or Google News already does it for free, your tool needs a 10x differentiated angle.
- **Lack evidence of demand**: "This would be useful" isn't enough. Show us the expensive subscription people are paying for (Query tools) or the fragmented APIs developers are struggling to normalize (Execute tools).

**The bar:** Can you find real Twitter threads, forum posts, or Reddit threads of people complaining or evangelising about paying for this specific data — or developers complaining about integrating multiple inconsistent APIs for it? If not, don't apply.
</Warning>

## 🎯 The Grant Pool

We're allocating **\$10,000 USD** to bootstrap the supply side of the Context Marketplace.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Pool** | \$10,000 USD |
| **Grant Range** | \$250 – \$1,000 per tool |
| **Expected Tools** | 15–40 new MCP servers |

---

## 🏆 Funding Tiers

### What Makes a Tier S Tool?

It depends on who you're building for.

**For Query mode** (Context is the librarian — \$0.10/response):

We pay for **answers**, not raw data dumps. Tier S Query tools do the heavy lifting so the AI can synthesize immediately.

| Feature | Raw Dump (❌) | Curated Intelligence (✅) |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Crypto** | "Here's the transaction list" | "Top 5 whales accumulating this token right now" |
| **Finance** | "Here's the SEC filing PDF" | "Key risk factors extracted with sentiment score" |
| **E-commerce** | "Here are Amazon search results" | "Estimated monthly revenue: \$47K, trending up 23%" |
| **Competitive Intel** | "Here's their homepage HTML" | "Tech stack: Stripe, Vercel, Segment. 2.3M monthly visitors" |

**For Execute mode** (developer's agent is the librarian — \$0.001/call):

We pay for **normalized, typed, reliable data** that an agent can iterate over. Tier S Execute tools eliminate the pain of integrating fragmented APIs.

| Feature | Single API Wrapper (❌) | Normalized Data Product (✅) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Crypto** | "Here's Binance prices" | "Cross-exchange prices in unified `{ exchange, pair, price, volume }` schema" |
| **Finance** | "Here's one SEC filing" | "Parsed 10-K/10-Q with structured metrics, comparable across companies" |
| **E-commerce** | "Here's one retailer's data" | "Product pricing across Amazon, Walmart, Target in consistent format" |
| **Competitive Intel** | "Here's one data source" | "Tech stack + traffic + hiring signals normalized per domain" |

---

### 🦄 Tier S: \$1,000 + Revenue Share

**High-value tools that replace expensive subscriptions or fragmented API integrations.**

For Query mode: complex pipelines, novel analysis, or hard-to-access sources that unlock data people currently pay \$500–\$20,000/year for. For Execute mode: normalized data infrastructure across multiple sources that eliminates painful multi-API integration for agent builders.

### 🛠️ Tier A: \$250-\$500 + Revenue Share

**High-utility tools agents use frequently.**

For Query mode: reliable, well-documented tools with smart curation. For Execute mode: well-typed, single-source data endpoints with consistent schemas and good coverage.

### 🚀 Tier B: Revenue Share Only

**Simple wrappers and adapters.**

No upfront grant, but immediate listing. Start earning from day one.

<Note>
**All tiers earn revenue share.** Even Tier B tools generate USDC the moment agents use them. You keep 90% of every fee.
</Note>

## 🔍 How to Find Unbundling Opportunities

Before pitching, do this research. Here's a real example of how to identify a fundable tool:

### Example: Finding a SensorTower Unbundling Opportunity

**Step 1: Search for frustrated paying users**

Go to [Grok](https://grok.com) and search Twitter:
- `"SensorTower" "pay" OR "subscription" OR "expensive"`
- `"app analytics" "not worth" OR "canceled" OR "only need"`

**Step 2: Find the specific pain point**

You might find tweets like:
> *"I pay \$400/month for SensorTower just to check competitor download estimates before investor calls. Everything else in the dashboard I never touch."*

> *"SensorTower is worth it for the App Store keyword rankings alone. Rest is noise."*

**Step 3: Isolate the \$0.10 response**

From this research, you'd identify: **"App download estimates by bundle ID"** is the core value. Build a tool that delivers just that. The specific data point people are paying \$5K/year to access occasionally.

**Step 4: Pitch with evidence**

Your proposal should say: *"SensorTower charges \$5K/year. Users on Twitter report paying primarily for download estimates. Here's my tool that delivers that specific data point for \$0.10/response. Here are 3 tweets proving demand."*

<Info>
**This is the bar for Query-mode tools.** Every idea in the curated intelligence section has been evaluated against this standard.
</Info>

### Example: Finding an Execute-Mode Normalization Opportunity

**Step 1: Search for frustrated developers**

Go to [Grok](https://grok.com) and search Twitter, GitHub issues, or Reddit:
- `"different schema" "exchange" OR "API" site:github.com`
- `"normalize" "crypto" "API" "pain" OR "nightmare" OR "inconsistent"`

**Step 2: Find the integration pain**

You might find posts like:
> *"Spent 3 days just getting Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken order book data into the same format. Every exchange returns depth differently."*

> *"Why does every SEC filing parser return a completely different JSON structure? I just want balance sheet data in a consistent schema."*

**Step 3: Isolate the \$0.001 method**

From this research, you'd identify: **"normalized order book data across exchanges"** is the value. Build a tool where `get_orderbook("BTC/USDT", "binance")` and `get_orderbook("BTC/USDT", "kraken")` return the exact same typed schema. The developer pays fractions of a cent per call instead of building and maintaining the normalization themselves.

**Step 4: Pitch with evidence**

Your proposal should say: *"Developers integrating multiple exchange APIs spend days normalizing schemas. Here are 3 GitHub issues/tweets showing the pain. My tool provides unified typed data across 10 exchanges at \$0.001/call. Here's the schema."*

<Info>
**This is the bar for Execute-mode tools.** Show us the fragmented API landscape and the developers struggling with it.
</Info>

## 📋 Request for Builders (RFB)

We're actively funding tools across these verticals. These ideas target **specific features of expensive subscriptions** (Query mode) and **fragmented data that needs normalization** (Execute mode), not commodity data. If you have a novel idea with evidence of demand, pitch it.

---

## 🧠 Request for Builders: Query Mode Intelligence

The ideas below are **Query mode** tools — curated intelligence that replaces expensive subscriptions at \$0.10/response. Context is the librarian; your tool provides the analysis.

### 🏢 Competitive Intelligence & Sales

---

### 📈 Financial Markets & Research

*Replaces: Bloomberg (\$24K/yr), FactSet (\$12K/yr), Capital IQ (\$20K/yr)*

Bloomberg's value is **parsed, structured financial data with analysis**, not raw filings you can get from EDGAR for free. Build tools that do the heavy lifting of extraction and interpretation.

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **SEC Filing Parser** | Turn 10-K/10-Q into structured JSON with key metrics, risk factors, and YoY changes | **S** |

| **Insider Trading Tracker** | Real-time Form 4 filings with context: who's buying/selling and historical patterns | **A** |
| **Institutional Holdings** | 13F filings parsed: what are hedge funds accumulating? Position changes quarter-over-quarter | **A** |
| **IPO Pipeline Analyzer** | Upcoming listings with S-1 analysis, pricing expectations, comparable valuations | **A** |

---

### ⚡ Crypto & DeFi

*Replaces: Nansen (\$2.5K/yr), Arkham (\$1.5K/yr)*

Nansen's value isn't rug checking or gas prices. It's **wallet labeling, smart money identification, and entity clustering**. That's what people pay \$2.5K/year for. Build tools that deliver those specific insights.

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Wallet Profiler** | Total P&L, biggest wins, current positions, activity patterns (the core Nansen feature) | **S** |
| **Smart Money Tracker** | Who are the wallets with consistent alpha? What are they accumulating right now? | **S** |
| **Entity Clustering** | Which wallets belong to the same entity? Surface connected wallets from on-chain patterns | **S** |
| **Whale Alert with Context** | Not just "big transfer". Labeled entities, historical context, likely intent | **S** |
| **Wallet Attribution** | Label unknown wallets: Is this a CEX? A fund? A known trader? Cross-reference patterns | **S** |

<Note>
**What we're NOT funding in crypto:** Honeypot detectors, gas oracles, yield aggregators, bridge routers. These are already solved by free tools (DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, exchange APIs) with no premium tier worth unbundling.

**What IS worth building:** For Query mode, wallet intelligence is the premium — that's what the \$2.5K/year Nansen subscription pays for. For Execute mode, cross-exchange normalized data (prices, order books, funding rates in a unified schema you build and maintain) is valuable infrastructure that eliminates the pain of integrating each exchange API separately.
</Note>

## 🔌 Request for Builders: Execute Mode Infrastructure

Beyond curated intelligence, there's an equally valuable category of tools designed for **Execute mode**: normalized data infrastructure that eliminates the pain of integrating fragmented APIs.

Execute-mode tools serve SDK developers whose agents iterate over structured data at ~$0.001/call. The value isn't in the analysis — it's in the **normalization, consistency, and reliability** of the data across multiple sources.

<Info>
**The evidence bar for Execute mode is different.** Instead of "show us the expensive subscription," show us the **fragmented API landscape** — the 5 different exchanges with 5 different schemas that developers currently integrate and maintain separately. If an agent builder would rather pay $0.001/call than spend a week normalizing data from multiple sources, that's a fundable tool.

**Reference implementation:** The [Normalized Data Provider](https://github.com/ctxprotocol/sdk/tree/main/examples/server/normalized-data-provider) example demonstrates the ideal Execute-mode architecture: background ingestion from Binance + Hyperliquid into a local cache, normalized schema, zero upstream rate limits at serving time.
</Info>

### ⚡ Crypto & DeFi Infrastructure

*Replaces: integrating Binance + Coinbase + Kraken + OKX + Bybit APIs individually*

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Cross-Exchange Price Feed** | Unified `{ exchange, pair, price, volume, timestamp }` schema across 10+ exchanges. One method, consistent types | **S** |
| **Order Book Aggregator** | Normalized depth data across exchanges — same schema whether it's Binance or Kraken | **A** |
| **Multi-Chain Transaction Normalizer** | Unified transaction format across EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon). Same schema, different chains | **S** |
| **DeFi Position Normalizer** | Yield positions, LP data, and staking across Aave, Compound, Lido, etc. in a consistent format | **S** |
| **Funding Rate Feed** | Perpetual funding rates across all major perp exchanges, normalized and comparable | **A** |

### 📈 Financial Data Infrastructure

*Replaces: integrating EDGAR + international filings + FRED + BLS separately*

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Multi-Source Financial Statements** | Balance sheet, income statement, cash flow in a consistent schema — whether the source is SEC, SEDAR, or Companies House | **S** |
| **Economic Indicator Feed** | Normalized macro data (GDP, CPI, unemployment, rates) across FRED, BLS, ECB, and BOJ. One schema, global coverage | **S** |
| **Corporate Events Feed** | Earnings dates, dividend announcements, splits, M&A — normalized across multiple data sources into a single event schema | **A** |

### 🏢 Business & Competitive Intelligence Infrastructure

*Replaces: integrating LinkedIn + Crunchbase + BuiltWith + SimilarWeb separately*

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Multi-Source Company Data** | Company metadata (size, funding, industry, tech stack) normalized across Crunchbase, PitchBook, LinkedIn, BuiltWith into one typed schema | **S** |
| **Job Market Feed** | Job postings normalized across Indeed, LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever — consistent `{ company, role, level, location, salary_range }` per listing | **A** |
| **Domain Intelligence Feed** | DNS records, SSL certs, WHOIS, tech stack, traffic estimates — all from one method with a consistent schema per domain | **A** |

### 🛒 E-commerce & Pricing Infrastructure

*Replaces: integrating Amazon + Walmart + Target + Shopify APIs separately*

| Tool Idea | Description | Tier |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Multi-Retailer Price Feed** | Product pricing across Amazon, Walmart, Target in a unified `{ retailer, product, price, availability, timestamp }` schema | **S** |
| **Review Aggregation Feed** | Product reviews normalized across retailers — same sentiment schema whether it's Amazon or Best Buy | **A** |

<Note>
**Execute-mode tools can also serve Query mode.** If you set `surface: "both"` and `queryEligible: true` in your `_meta`, the Context app can use your normalized data as a source for curated responses too. Build for Execute, unlock both revenue streams with one line of config. See [Choosing a Mode](/guides/tool-metadata#choosing-a-mode).
