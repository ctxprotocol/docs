## Why use Context?

- 🔌 **One Interface, Everything:** Stop integrating APIs one by one. Use a single SDK to access any tool in the marketplace.
- 🧠 **Zero-Ops:** We're a gateway to the best MCP tools. Just send the JSON and get the result.
- ⚡️ **Agentic Discovery:** Your Agent can search the marketplace at runtime to find tools it didn't know it needed.
- 💸 **Simple Pricing:** Pay per response for curated intelligence, or pay per call for raw data — your choice.

## The Ecosystem

Context is not just a chatbot — it's an **economic engine for the AI era**. We connect three distinct groups in a decentralized marketplace for [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools.

Build a standard MCP server, paste your endpoint URL, set a price, and get paid in USDC when agents use your tool.

## For Users: The "God Mode" Agent

Stop switching tabs. Context gives you an AI agent with **real-time, read/write access to the world**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Auto Mode" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Ask *"Find the best yield on Base"* and the Agent autonomously searches the marketplace, buys the necessary data tools, analyzes the returns, and presents the answer.

  <Card title="One Wallet" icon="wallet">
    Pay for everything — from gas data to premium stock analysis — using a single USDC balance. No subscriptions, just pay-per-response.

## For Tool Builders: The "App Store" for MCP

Monetize your data **without building a frontend**. Turn the insights people pay \$500/year for into \$0.10/response revenue you keep.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Build Once, Sell Everywhere** | Create a standard MCP Server |
| **Zero UI Required** | You provide the API; our Agent provides the interface |
| **Instant Revenue** | Set a price (e.g., \$0.01/response). Get paid in USDC on Base every time an Agent successfully uses your tool |

---

## For App Developers: The Universal Adapter

Build your own agents using the Context Protocol as your **infrastructure layer**.

Every API you integrate means reading docs, managing auth keys, handling rate limits, parsing a unique response schema, and maintaining it when they change. Multiply that by 5 data sources and you've lost a week before writing any business logic.

<Steps>
  <Step title="One SDK, Hundreds of APIs">
    Instead of integrating CoinGecko, Tavily, and Weather APIs separately, just install `@ctxprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript) or `ctxprotocol` (Python). One auth token, one interface, consistent typed schemas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic Discovery">
    Your agent can search the marketplace at runtime: `client.discovery.search("gas prices")`. It finds tools it didn't know existed and uses them without human intervention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schema Inspection">
    Every tool exposes full Input/Output schemas. Your LLM can self-construct arguments and execute tools it has never seen before — no hardcoded integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Budgets, Not Blank Checks">
    Give your agent a spending limit (`maxSpendUsd: "2.00"`) and let it explore. You control exactly how much it can spend per session.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The npm/pip for AI Capabilities

<Info>
**"Context Protocol is npm/pip for AI capabilities."**

Just as `npm install` or `pip install` gives you code other people wrote, Context gives your Agent **capabilities other people built**.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { ContextClient } from "@ctxprotocol/sdk";

const client = new ContextClient({ apiKey: "sk_live_..." });

const answer = await client.query.run("What are the top whale movements on Base?");
console.log(answer.response);
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from ctxprotocol import ContextClient

async def main():
    async with ContextClient(api_key="sk_live_...") as client:
        answer = await client.query.run("What are the top whale movements on Base?")
        print(answer.response)

asyncio.run(main())
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
**Want more control?** The SDK also supports [Execute mode](/sdk/reference#tools-execute-mode) for per-call pricing with spending limits — ideal for custom agent pipelines. See the [Agentic Pattern](/sdk/agentic-pattern) guide or the [SDK Reference](/sdk/reference).
