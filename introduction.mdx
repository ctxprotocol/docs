## The Ecosystem

Context is not just a chatbot — it's an **economic engine for the AI era**. We connect three distinct groups in a decentralized marketplace for [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools.

Build a standard MCP server, paste your endpoint URL, set a price, and get paid in USDC every time an AI agent uses your tool.

---

## For Users: The "God Mode" Agent

Stop switching tabs. Context gives you an AI agent with **real-time, read/write access to the world**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Auto Mode" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Ask *"Find the best yield on Base"* and the Agent autonomously searches the marketplace, buys the necessary data tools, analyzes the returns, and presents the answer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="One Wallet" icon="wallet">
    Pay for everything — from gas data to premium stock analysis — using a single USDC balance. No subscriptions, just pay-per-query.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## For Tool Builders: The "App Store" for MCP

Monetize your data **without building a frontend**.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Build Once, Sell Everywhere** | Create a standard MCP Server |
| **Zero UI Required** | You provide the API; our Agent provides the interface |
| **Instant Revenue** | Set a price (e.g., $0.01/query). Get paid in USDC instantly every time an Agent calls your tool |

---

## For App Developers: The Universal Adapter

Build your own agents using the Context Protocol as your **infrastructure layer**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Integrating APIs">
    Instead of integrating CoinGecko, Tavily, and Weather APIs separately, just install `@ctxprotocol/sdk`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic Discovery">
    Your agent can search our marketplace at runtime: `client.discovery.search("gas prices")`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schema Inspection">
    The API exposes full Input/Output schemas, allowing your LLM to self-construct arguments and execute tools it has never seen before.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zero-Ops">
    We host the connections. You just send JSON and get results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The npm for AI Capabilities

<Info>
**"Context Protocol is npm for AI capabilities."**

Just as `npm install` gives you code other people wrote, Context gives your Agent **capabilities other people built**.
</Info>

```typescript
import { ContextClient } from "@ctxprotocol/sdk";

const client = new ContextClient({ apiKey: "sk_live_..." });

// Discover tools dynamically
const tools = await client.discovery.search("ethereum gas prices");

// Execute any tool from the marketplace
const result = await client.tools.execute({
  toolId: tools[0].id,
  toolName: tools[0].mcpTools[0].name,
  args: { chainId: 1 },
});
```
