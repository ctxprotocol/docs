## Why use Context?

- 🔌 **One Interface, Everything:** Stop integrating APIs one by one. Use a single SDK to access any tool in the marketplace.
- 🧠 **Zero-Ops:** We're a gateway to the best MCP tools. Just send the JSON and get the result.
- ⚡️ **Agentic Discovery:** Your Agent can search the marketplace at runtime to find tools it didn't know it needed.
- 💸 **Dual-Surface Economics:** Use Query for pay-per-response intelligence or Execute for session-budgeted method calls.

---

## Who Is This SDK For?

| Role | What You Use |
|------|--------------|
| **AI Agent Developer** | `@ctxprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript) or `ctxprotocol` (Python) — Query for curated answers or Execute with explicit method pricing + session budgets |
| **Tool Contributor (Data Broker)** | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `@ctxprotocol/sdk` — Standard MCP server + security middleware |

<Info>
**For AI Agent Developers:** Use the SDK to search one marketplace with two surfaces:
- **Query surface** for curated answers (pay-per-response)
- **Execute surface** for deterministic method calls (per-call pricing inside execute sessions)

**For Tool Contributors:** You need **both** SDKs:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — Build your MCP server (tools, schemas, handlers)
- `@ctxprotocol/sdk` — Secure your endpoint with `createContextMiddleware()` to verify requests
</Info>

<Info>
**Tool contributors wrapping rate-limited APIs:** publish `_meta.rateLimit` hints so Context can pace planner/runtime calls safely. Start with [Tool Metadata](/guides/tool-metadata#rate-limit-hints).
</Info>

---

## The Ecosystem

Context is not just a chatbot — it's an **economic engine for the AI era**. We connect three distinct groups in a decentralized marketplace for [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tools.

Build a standard MCP server, paste your endpoint URL, set a listing response price, optionally add method-level execute pricing, and get paid in USDC when agents use your tool.

---

## One Marketplace, Two Surfaces

Listings can expose methods to one or both surfaces using method metadata (`_meta.surface`):

| Surface | Who is the librarian? | Billing model | Method eligibility |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Query** | Context app/runtime | Pay-per-response | `surface` is `answer` or `both` and `queryEligible=true` |
| **Execute** | Your app/agent | Per execute call (session-budgeted) | Explicit method execute pricing (`_meta.pricing.executeUsd`) |

<Info>
Mixed listings are supported immediately. A listing can have some methods for Query and others for Execute. Methods without explicit execute pricing remain query-only.
</Info>

---

## For Users: The "God Mode" Agent

Stop switching tabs. Context gives you an AI agent with **real-time, read/write access to the world**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Auto Mode" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Ask *"Find the best yield on Base"* and the Agent autonomously searches the marketplace, buys the necessary data tools, analyzes the returns, and presents the answer.
  </Card>
  <Card title="One Wallet" icon="wallet">
    Pay for everything — from gas data to premium stock analysis — using a single USDC balance. No subscriptions, just pay-per-response.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## For Tool Builders: The "App Store" for MCP

Monetize your data **without building a frontend**. Turn the insights people pay \$500/year for into \$0.10/response revenue you keep.

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Build Once, Sell Everywhere** | Create a standard MCP Server |
| **Zero UI Required** | You provide the API; our Agent provides the interface |
| **Instant Revenue** | Set a price (e.g., \$0.01/response). Get paid in USDC on Base every time an Agent successfully uses your tool |

---

## For App Developers: The Universal Adapter

Build your own agents using the Context Protocol as your **infrastructure layer**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Integrating APIs">
    Instead of integrating CoinGecko, Tavily, and Weather APIs separately, just install `@ctxprotocol/sdk` (TypeScript) or `ctxprotocol` (Python).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic Discovery">
    Your agent can search our marketplace at runtime: `client.discovery.search("gas prices")`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schema Inspection">
    The API exposes full Input/Output schemas, allowing your LLM to self-construct arguments and execute tools it has never seen before.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zero-Ops">
    We host the connections. You just send JSON and get results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The npm/pip for AI Capabilities

<Info>
**"Context Protocol is npm/pip for AI capabilities."**

Just as `npm install` or `pip install` gives you code other people wrote, Context gives your Agent **capabilities other people built**.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { ContextClient } from "@ctxprotocol/sdk";

const client = new ContextClient({ apiKey: "sk_live_..." });

// Query surface: curated intelligence, pay-per-response
const answer = await client.query.run("What are the top whale movements on Base?");

// Execute surface: explicit execute pricing + session budget
const executeTools = await client.discovery.search({
  query: "ethereum gas prices",
  mode: "execute",
  surface: "execute",
  requireExecutePricing: true,
});

const session = await client.tools.startSession({ maxSpendUsd: "2.00" });
const method = executeTools[0]?.mcpTools?.[0];
if (!method) throw new Error("No execute method available");

const result = await client.tools.execute({
  toolId: executeTools[0].id,
  toolName: method.name,
  args: { chainId: 1 },
  sessionId: session.session.sessionId ?? undefined,
});
console.log(result.session); // { methodPrice, spent, remaining, maxSpend, ... }
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from ctxprotocol import ContextClient

async def main():
    async with ContextClient(api_key="sk_live_...") as client:
        # Query surface
        answer = await client.query.run("What are the top whale movements on Base?")

        # Execute surface: discover execute-priced methods
        tools = await client.discovery.search(
            "ethereum gas prices",
            mode="execute",
            surface="execute",
            require_execute_pricing=True,
        )

        session = await client.tools.start_session(max_spend_usd="2.00")
        method = tools[0].mcp_tools[0]

        # Execute with session budget envelope
        result = await client.tools.execute(
            tool_id=tools[0].id,
            tool_name=method.name,
            args={"chainId": 1},
            session_id=session.session.session_id,
        )
        print(result.session)  # method_price, spent, remaining, max_spend, ...

asyncio.run(main())
